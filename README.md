# Algorithms
This repository contains work done in my analysis of algorithms class.

# Insertion Sort and Insertion Sort Time
These programs handle an insertion sort algorithm. Insertsort.cpp tests the algorithm out, while insertTime.cpp measures how fast it is sorting very large arrays (giving a better picture of how it compares to merge sort).

# Merge Sort and Merge Sort Time
Similar to insertion sort, these programs handle a merge sort algorithm. Mergesort.cpp tests the algorithm, while mergeTime.cpp measures how fast it is when used at a larger scale. Merge sort is much faster than insertion sort when thousands of items are in the sorted array.
